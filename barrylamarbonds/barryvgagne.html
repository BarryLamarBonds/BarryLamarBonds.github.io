		<h1>The Battle of the Century: Barry Lamar Bonds vs. Eric Gagne</h1>

		<p>The year was 2004. In the 9th inning of a game in San Francisco, all of the baseball world turned their eyes to SBC park to watch two of the game's best players go head to head. It is not too often that people will tell stories about a specific at-bat during an early regular season game, but this was different. First of all, the Dodgers and Giants have one of the biggest rivalries in baseball. On top of that, you have a reliever who was in the middle of a record-setting 84 save streak squaring off against baseball's best player who would finish the '04 season with a record-setting OBP of .609. Two of the most polarizing players of the last two decades went to battle, pitch after pitch, and it was Barry Lamar Bonds who came out on top. The only problem with Barry's efforts is that the Giants were down by 3 and his homer was only good for 2, so while Barry got Gagne, the save streak lived on.</p>
