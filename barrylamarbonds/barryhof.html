		<h1>The Case for the Hall</h1>
		<p>It is time for the baseball writers association of America and all the degenerates who think Barr Lamar Bonds doesn't belong in the Hall of Fame to wake up. "But he took steroids." Yeah he probably did, so what. Every era had some way of violating the rules to enhance their performance and Barry played in the steroid era. But if steroids do that much for you to help you on the baseball field, then how come nobody else put up the type of numbers that Bonds did. He was playing against hitters and pitchers who were juicing and still destroyed every one else on that field. For example, OPS+ is a league adjusted stat that takes everyone's On Base + Slugging Percentage and turns them into a number with 100 being the league average. Therefore, that specific stat adjusts to the specific era of baseball depending on the year. Barry Lamar Bonds had 6 seasons in his career with an OPS+ over 200. 6 years with an OPS that was at least double the league average. If you threw the man a strike, it was likely getting hit over the fence. You can't tell the story of baseball without Barry Bonds, and he is the greatest player to ever set foot on a major league field. Get this man in the Hall of Fame</p>
