		<h1>Let's Talk Intentional Walks</h1>
		<p>I had to make a separate page just for intentional walks because Barry Lamar Bonds is a man who can be referred to as the Greek God of intentional Walks. I want to start this section of my shrine to Barry with a brief little story. One time, the Giants were playing a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Barry came to the plate in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and the Giants were down by two. Watch what happened next.</p>
        
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xi7IPZAcP78" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        
        <p>That's right. Arizona opted to give the Giants a free run during the 9th inning rather than taking the risk of pitching to Barry Lamar Bonds. Unreal.</p>
        
        <p>That is not all though, there are tons of intentional walk numbers from the career of Barry Lamar Bonds that will blow you away. Here's a few:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>To this day, Barry Lamar Bonds still has more career intentional walks than the entire Tampa Bay Rays franchise in the history of their existence</li>
            <li>Barry Lamar Bonds is the only player in mlb to record over 30 intentional walks in 3 or more seasons. He has recorded over 30 intentional walks in ten different seasons</li>
            <li>In the years 2001-2004, the league leaders in intentional walks went as followed: 
                <ol>
                    <li>Barry Lamar Bonds (284) </li>
                    <li>The St. Louis Cardinals (260) </li>
                    <li>The Montreal Expos (252) (rest in peace) </li>
                    <li>The Philadelphia Phillies (237) </li>
                    <li>The Arizona Diamondbacks (232) Barry had more intentional walks than any other TEAM in that stretch.</li> 
                </ol>
            </li> 
            <li>In his career, Barry Lamar Bonds walked unintentionally 1870 times and intentionally 688 times. That means that Barry walked 43.6 miles in his career</li>
        </ul>
