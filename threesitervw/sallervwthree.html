    <p>I do not like this website because it is more in your face than a rain storm while you are on a run. There is so much going on when you open the site and it is almost hard to look at. It looks like a pop up site that would give a computer a virus.</p>
    
    <p>I am not going to lie, the code to this site is one of the most incredible things that I have ever seen and honestly Jeff, I encourage you to look at it. The code is shaped in the mold of Ling's face and looks like an advertisement for the company. The HTML5 are used correctly but man oh man, it is truly difficult to pay attention to anything else with Ling staring you in the face.</p>
    
    <p>As far as the layout of this site goes, it is fine but there are just so many moving parts and is incredibly difficult to pay attention to any single thing. It definitely does not make me want to buy a car.</p>
    
    <p>Lings Cars website is a pretty easy site to navigate, but it is hard to lock in and accomplish anything on the site because of ll the crap that is being thrown in your face. I really do encourage you to check it out because it is mentally, physically, and emotionally exhausting.</p>
    
    <p>The last site I reviewed didn't have nearly enough color, but this one here has way too much. There are patterns all over the place throwing different shades of blue, red, orange and God knows what else like you are taking a walk through Times Square. A truly ineffective overusage of colors that makes literally zero sense and probably zero business for Lings Cars.</p>
    
    <P>This site definitely sets itself apart from the others with the amount of color and movement on it. It is actually unfathomable and makes me want to go lay down rather than purchase an automobile. I give props to whoever designed this site because it must have taken a lot of work to code it and get all that junk in there but MAN OH MAN, this site is an absolute stinker.</P>
