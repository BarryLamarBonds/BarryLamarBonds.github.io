    <p>For starters, I like how consistent ESPN is with their color way. If you watch ESPN or go to their website, they are going to throw some red and grey into your face because they are the worldwide leader in sports and that is their brand. I also really like how often they update it, like when there is a close game happening and they have the score and highlights right in the center of their home page.</p>
    
    <p>I looked at the code for ESPN and it wasn't as clean as I would have thought with it being one of the biggest and best web sites out there. I also am used to coding a lot less material than that so I understand that it might be a little tougher to space the coding out like I do. They do use the HTLM5 elements and it validates.</p>
    
    <p>The layout makes a lot of sense to me. There are so many aspects of their website between college sports, professional sports, articles, team info, watch ESPN, and fantasy sports. There is a clear path to get to all the different aspects of the website. I would say it is definitely laid out in a way that is user friendly.</p>
    
    <p>Like I mentioned in the last paragraph, it is very easy to navigate. ESPN is a site that I have frequently visited since I was in elementary school and even then I could work my way around it with no problem.</p>
    
    <p>ESPN uses a decent plethora of colors, but the ain theme is their red, grey, and white because it is their brand.They also have a lot of scores at the top of the home page and next to the team names are all the teams' logos so there are a lot of different colors. Simple white body with blak text for the most part.</p>
    
    <P>I think the way that this site sets itself apart is how they are able to make their site so detailed and have so much depth to it while making it so easy to navigate. I feel like it would be common for it to be complicated, but ESPN nailed it.</P>
