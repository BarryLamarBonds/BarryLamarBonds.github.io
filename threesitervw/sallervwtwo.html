    <p>I dislike this website because it looks like something I would have put together for this class about 3 weeks into the semester. The reason this site sets it apart from others is that it has absolutely nothing to be excited about especially with it being a site of a famous author to a very polarizing book series.</p>
    
    <p>The code is pretty simple given the fact that it is very simple. It does use the HTML5 and it is very cleanly put together. It is spaced and indented in a very smooth manner. Easy to understand for someone with little coding experience like myself.</p>
    
    <p>The layout of this website is objectively bad. For starters, the nav bar at the top is not centered and is tucked off to the top right in small font. The sections on the side are very inconveniently located, and there is just an overall lack of content. Not a fan personally.</p>
    
    <p>This site isn't necessarily difficult to navigate on because it is so bland and basic. I did not have any troubles making my way around it to say the least.</p>
    
    <p>This site is mainly all white with black text and just a tad bit of blue text. I am not sure how it was decided but for some reason, the main color around the perimeter of the website is this gross hybrid yellow-orange-red-ish color that is very unappealing to the eyes. Suzanne can do better than this.</p>
    
    <P>This site does nothing good to set itself apart. The Times New Roman font isn't exactly something that made me jump out of my seat either. It is almost like Collins paid someone to make her site before it was actually done so they just dooped her out of a few bucks and put one together in five minutes.</P>
