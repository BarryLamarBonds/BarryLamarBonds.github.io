                <h1>All-American Father Figure</h1>
                <p>Cooper Kupp has made his living as an absolute assassin out on the football field. He is now known as the most statistically dominant wide reciever in college football history and makes his coin playing for the Los Angeles Rams. If he didn't tear his ACL this season and have to miss the playoffs, the Rams may have been able to take down the GOAT, Tom Brady, and the New England Patriots.</p>
